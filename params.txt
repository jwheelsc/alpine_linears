The parameters below work for the original section of crack

bcs = 5             ## this is the size of the center chip used to move through the linear trough
halfBcs = int(np.floor(bcs/2))
bckChipSize = 11    ## this is the size of the chip used to identify the background
halfBkgChip = int(np.floor(bckChipSize/2))
diffAnomThresh = 11  ## this is how far above the background the center pixel must be to qualify as a starting point
dmSz = 155          ## the size of the sampling window
gaussSigma=1.1      ## size of the standard deviation of the gaussian smooting window
distThresh = 1
minCrackLength = 10
