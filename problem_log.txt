for the wrinkled terrain, the unique element matrix section 
works well, but it doesn't work for the flat section of terrain

for the flat section, specifying that the chip be a certain
distance in y from the top boundary works for the flat terrain, but it doesn't for the 
wrinkled terrain

when I come back, reread the code to understand it fully, then 
fix the uniqe random number matrix so that it works for all,
then figure out how to work with the boundary problem described above
and figure out what to do if n_j is great than 1 (two elements)
are the same distance, probably by averagin x and y values
